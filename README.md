# com.jogamp.jogl
An Eclipse plugin project to encapsulate Java OpenGL (JOGL) and allow it to be used in Eclipse RCP projects.

To use JOGL in an Eclipse RCP project, just add this plugin to your workspace and make your RCP project depend on it. It contains the JOGL JAR files for the five most common platforms. If you want to update to the latest version of JOGL, it's easy to just pull the most recent JAR files from the newest release at http://jogamp.org/deployment/archive/rc/ and put them into this project.

My tutorial at https://github.com/WadeWalker/name.wadewalker.tutorial is an example of how to use this project.
